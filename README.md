# uTube Lite

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

uTube Lite is a lightweight edition of [uTube](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/website-utilities/utube) - the ultimate YouTube package for Umbraco.

## (Limited) Features

This cut-down version of the package installs the following:

* [Macro] uTube Classic Player
* [DataType] uTube Single Video Picker

### Umbraco compatiability

This package was compiled against Umbraco v6.0.5 (via [NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/UmbracoCms.Core/6.0.5)). If support for an earlier version of Umbraco is required, please either raise an issue or feel free to submit a pull-request.

## Why a lightweight edition?

The original [uTube](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/website-utilities/utube) package contained addition data-type editors and lots of front-end goodies, including excellent support for the chromeless player.

However I very seldom require the additional functionality. In most cases all I needed was the simple data-type editor and macro to display a video. So here is my fork.

If at some point there are additional features to be added, I would look to also include those in the original [uTube](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/website-utilities/utube) package.
